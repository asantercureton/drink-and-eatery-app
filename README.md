## Usage
As a user, I select a radio button within the food options to specify a food cuisine, then search for a particular food ingredient to retrieve a list of recipes with image and serving size. I input an ingredient within the search bar of the drink section to retrieve a list of drink recipes with image, ingredients and instructions.
